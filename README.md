# Relax
This script is inspired by [Awarenes](http://iamfutureproof.com/tools/awareness/): The idea is to detect if you work too hard, and leave you alone otherwise. If you take at least a 5 minute break during an hour then nothing happens. A gong sounds in the other case.

Run "python main.py" to start the script. More instructions about installation are coming.
