# Relax
This script is inspired by [Awarenes](http://iamfutureproof.com/tools/awareness/): The idea is to detect if you work too hard, it will leave you alone otherwise. If you take at least a 5 minute break during an hour nothing happens, otherwise a gong will sound.

Run "python main.py" to start the script. Do not move main.py from its directory.
